⌨️ Currently helping to build a cloud security platform. Most of my work is closed-source.

- 🔭 For work I'm mostly focused on Golang, Linux, Kubernetes and Cloud (AWS/GCP). I still work in Java now and again, which I've worked in for most of my career.
- 🌱 I'm currently working on my C++ and Rust. I'm always learning more about distributed systems and cloud native design.
- 👯 I'd love to collaborate on high-performance libraries. Please reach out if you have a project which fits, this is an area I enjoy working in.
